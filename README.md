# Heart Attack prediction and analysis

## Project overview

This project aims to find a suitable machine-learning model that can be used to predict future heart attack cases. It uses real-data from patients to train the model.
The objective of this project is to be able to process and prepare the data as well as to find an accurate model and contrast its reliability with several methods. 

In the jupyter notebook you will find all the steps followed, as well as several helpful comments and notes.
This project was a very interesting and entertaining way to practise machine learning algorithms of up-to-date real cases.
